<h3>This is a guide to make butter chicken. Butter chicken is my favorite dish from India.</h3>
<p>These butter chicken breasts are dipped in beaten eggs and cracker crumbs, then baked with butter. These chicken breasts are really tender and moist with excellent flavor! I never have leftovers.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
    <li>1 cup crushed buttery round cracker crumbs</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
    <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>½ cup butter, cut into pieces</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>
    <li>Place eggs and cracker crumbs into 2 separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Dip chicken in eggs, then dredge in crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Scatter butter around chicken.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
