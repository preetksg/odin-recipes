<p>Delicious lemony baked chicken breast. Pairs nicely with a baked potato.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>2 (5 ounce) chicken breasts</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    <li>salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
    <li>â…› teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1 medium lemon, halved</li>
    <li>1 bunch fresh basil, chopped</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.</li>
    <li>Wash chicken breasts and pat dry with paper towels. Trim and discard fat. Tenderize chicken with a meat mallet. Rub 1 tablespoon olive oil on each breast, lightly covering both front and back. Season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder and set on the prepared baking sheet.</li>
    <li>Squeeze juice from one lemon half over the chicken breasts. Sprinkle with basil. Cut 2 slices of lemon from the remaining half and set 1 slice on each breast. Reserve remaining lemon for another use.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken breast is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from oven, cover with foil, and allow to rest for 7 minutes before serving.</li>
